I have used No Ai Assitance in this assignment. I find LLM's and other forms of generative systems a distasteful and inefficient means of working 
when compared to consulting peers and utilities like Stack Overflow.

I would like to apologise for the late submission and I am disappointed by my own output in this Assignment, 
however, I would request some leniency in marking as I have struggled with mental health, my adhd and working alone on this assignment, 
during the second half of this course. I should have requested assistance before now however completing work for other courses and requirements 
outside of university have led to a lot of time where I was unable to progress on this and thus accurately determine how much I would struggle 
once I could focus all of my attention on this Assignment.

Thank You.
